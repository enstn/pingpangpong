# PingPangPong <sup>(non racist edition)</sup>
This is my trials & error to get some neurons to pingpang some pongs.
Inspired by this 2022 [paper](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(22)00806-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0896627322008066%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) from [Cortical Labs](https://corticallabs.com/) :shipit:

## ToDos
- [ ] train a classical agent to get a hang
- [ ] transition from RNN to SNN
- [ ] transition from PyTorch to BRIAN 

## WannaDos
- [ ] some scoring animations (maybe not a good idea for training though)
- [ ] rebound sounds! (there is no "ping" "pang" or "pong" without actual bonging sounds - crucial element)
