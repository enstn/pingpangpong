# PingPangPong <sup>(non racist edition)</sup>
This is my trials & error to get neurons to pingpang some pongs, inspired by this 2022 [paper](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(22)00806-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0896627322008066%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) from [Cortical Labs](https://corticallabs.com/).

## ToDos
- [x] make a working game instance in Rust
    - [ ] fix edge bug 
- [ ] train a classical agent to get a hang 
    - [x] testagent 
    - [ ] set up bindings
    - [ ] set up network
    - [ ] set up policy 
    - [ ] somehow integrate into Colab for GPU leverage
- [ ] transition from RL to SNN
- [ ] transition from PyTorch to BRIAN 

## WannaDos
- [ ] ~~some scoring animations~~ (not a good idea for RNN training)
- [ ] rebound sounds! (bongs are crucial elements)
